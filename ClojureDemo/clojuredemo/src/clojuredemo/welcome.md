This codebase contains several unrelated clojure files wich I created while learning the language.

Each file contains code related to one topic. You can use this to understand the syntax and concept.

Although each file is independent of other and there is no sequence to be followed, however, if you are someone who enjoy reading things in a sequence then please go through the files in following order.
* basic_syntax.clj
* data_types.clj
* datastructure.clj
* control_structure.clj
* local_var.clj
* loop.clj
* exception_handling.clj
* namespaces.clj
* functional_programming.clj
* destructure.clj
* threadingmacro,clj
* recursion.clj
* closure.clj
